                    At DURABLE FURNITURES, we develop beautiful designs from the best materials to ensure a high, enduring quality. That's why we offer a 5-year warranty on all our product designs - but of course we expect them to last even longer.

                        The warranty provided by BoConcept A/S is valid according to the terms and  conditions set out in these warranty terms and is a very special extra service   we offer in addition to the statutory warranty. The warranty therefore does not   affect your mandatory rights under applicable law.
